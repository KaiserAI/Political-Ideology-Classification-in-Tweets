## 📋 Project Overview
Social media platforms generate massive amounts of political discourse daily. Analyzing this data manually is unfeasible. This project develops an automated **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** pipeline to classify the ideological stance of Spanish tweets.

The system analyzes linguistic patterns to categorize text into four distinct segments: **Left, Moderate Left, Moderate Right, and Right**.

### Key Objectives
* **Data Engineering:** Implementation of a robust preprocessing pipeline to handle social media noise (slang, emojis, mentions).
* **Benchmarking:** Rigorous comparison between Classical Machine Learning models and Deep Learning architectures.
* **SOTA Adaptation:** Fine-tuning the **BETO (Spanish BERT)** Transformer model to capture semantic nuance and context.

## ⚙️ Methodology

The project follows a structured data science lifecycle, detailed in *Chapter 3 & 4* of the attached report.

### 1. Data Processing
Using the `politicES_phase_2` dataset, the raw text undergoes a strict cleaning process:
* **Normalization:** Lowercasing and removal of special characters.
* **Noise Removal:** Regex-based filtering of URLs, hashtags (`#`), and user mentions (`@`).
* **Linguistic Processing:** Tokenization, Stop-word removal, and Lemmatization to reduce feature dimensionality.

### 2. Model Architecture
I engineered and evaluated three tiers of models to find the optimal performance trade-off:

| Tier | Models Implemented | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Baselines** | Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest | Statistical approaches using **TF-IDF** vectorization. |
| **2. Deep Learning** | Bi-LSTM | Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network with embedding layers to capture sequence order. |
| **3. SOTA** | **BETO (Transformers)** | Transfer learning using the pre-trained Spanish BERT model, fine-tuned for sequence classification. |
